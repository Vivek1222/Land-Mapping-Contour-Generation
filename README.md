# Land-Mapping-Contour-Generation
This project focuses on using QGIS, a powerful open-source geographic information system (GIS), to map land parcels and generate contour lines for terrain analysis. The project involves working with both vector and raster data to create detailed, informative maps that aid in land use planning, agriculture, and infrastructure development.
